Overview:
Our project revolves around drafting an IDE Search Engine that will exist as a plugin inside of an IDE and will use 
AI technology to serve as a chatbot for coding related questions as well as containing a feature that will scan code
and give personalized feedback. Through various software development processes and plans and meetings, we were able to draft
how the project would work as well as how it would be implemented, deployed, and maintaned.
